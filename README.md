androidwisprclient
==================

An Android client for automatic authentication in FON network using WISPr

Supports routers managed by FON and partners (BT, Neuf, Zon, Comstar, etc)

This is a fork of https://github.com/jfisbein/androidwisprclient blessed by the original author, Joan Fisbein.

I intend to:

✓ Fix internet connectivity detection

✓ Add support for Netia routers (FON_NETIA_FREE_INTERNET) [this is done, no special treatment was needed, it was a general bug that's fixed]

3) Try to get this code on F-Droid

4) Accept pull requests from you (DIY style, your pull requests are welcome but your issues are not)
