androidwisprclient
==================

An Android client for automatic authentication in FON network using WISPr

Supports routers managed by FON and partners (BT, Neuf, Zon, Comstar, etc)

This is a fork of https://code.google.com/p/androidwisprclient/

I intend to:

1) Fix internet connectivity detection

2) Add support for Netia routers (FON_NETIA_FREE_INTERNET)

3) Try to get this code on F-Droid

4) Accept pull requests from you (DIY style, your pull requests are welcome but your issues are not)
